 🎵 Music Recommendation System using Machine Learning
> A *content-based music recommendation system* built using *Machine Learning & Python* that suggests similar songs based on audio features.

 ✨ Project Overview
This project recommends *similar songs* to a given track by analyzing *Spotify audio features* such as danceability, energy, tempo, loudness, and more.
The system uses *Machine Learning similarity techniques* to provide accurate and meaningful music recommendations.

📌 *Type*: Content-Based Recommendation System  
📌 *Domain*: Machine Learning / Data Science  

🧠 Machine Learning Concepts Used
  🔹 *Feature Scaling* using StandardScaler
  🔹 *Cosine Similarity* for measuring similarity between songs
  🔹 *Content-Based Filtering*
